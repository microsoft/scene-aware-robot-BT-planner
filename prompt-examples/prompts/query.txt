Start working. Resume from the environment below.
"""
{"environment":[ENVIRONMENT]}
"""
The instruction is as follows:
"""
{"instruction": [INSTRUCTION]}
"""
The dictionary that you return must be formatted as a Python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. DO NOT USE undefined verbs. USE ONLY verbs in "ROBOT ACTION LIST".
2. The arguments of the ROBOT ACTIONs must be selected from the objects in the environment.
3. You must output a valid Python dictionary. Never leave ',' at the end of the list.
4. Insert "```python" at the beginning and the insert "```" at end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response. That is, your response must be formatted as follows:
```python
{... your response, which must be a valid Python dictionary...}
5. When there is a conditional branch, make sure to consider the else case even if it is not explicitly instructed.
```

Adhere to the output format I defined above. Note that the input text is not case sensitive. Follow the four rules. Think step by step.
